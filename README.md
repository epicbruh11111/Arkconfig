# Ark arch linux hyprland config

<p>
this config is a fork of the "simple-hyprland" github repo    

  (https://github.com/gaurav23b/simple-hyprland)   <- link
</p>

## What is so different from the github page of "simple-hyprland"
- ✅ more moodern tools
- ✅ dunst:X11 -> swaync:wayland
- ALOT MORE
- ✅ support with cutting edge changes (not as slow as simple-hyprland)

cons
-  no docs
-  can be broken (not always like only 5% chance)
-  primegen would hate this (pro for me! but not for you sucker)

Just read this:

(if this config becomes huge and unsimple but I'll try to make it simple)
