# Ark arch linux hyprland config

<p>
this config is a fork of the "simple-hyprland" github repo    

  (https://github.com/gaurav23b/simple-hyprland)   <- link
</p>

## What is so different from the github page of "simple-hyprland"
- ✅ more moodern tools
- ✅ dunst:X11 -> swaync:wayland
- ✅ support with cutting edge changes (not as slow as simple-hyprland)

cons
-  no docs
-  can be broken (not always like only 5% chance)
-  primegen would hate this (pro for me! but not for you sucker)


# Installation:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/epicbruh11111/Arkconfig ~/Arkconfig
cd ~/Arkconfig/scripts/installer
chmod +x ./install.sh
sudo sh ./install.sh

```

# Documentation

Just read this:
https://github.com/gaurav23b/simple-hyprland

this config is at its start point so using simple-hyprland's docs on this config is gonna be sweet
(if this config becomes huge and unsimple but I'll try to make it simple)

# Version: 1.5
# Update:
- tofi -> rofi 
- cava
- btop/btop++
- update hyprland config

# Update description

tofi isn't too modern as most preconfigured setups and rofi foxes that

cava is nice but I wont implement it in waybar please manually do it

btops is nice for cli preformance checking

syncing changes to hyprland.conf to make new stuff automated
